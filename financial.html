            <p> Many people have minimized their money problems by applying Bible principles.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #e8b923">HAVE A GOOD PLAN</h3>
            <p><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: "The plans of the diligent surely lead to success, but who are hasty surely head for poverty."-Proverbs 21:5.</strong></p>
            <p><span>WHAT IT MEANS: </span> Diligent sticking to your plans is an important key to sucess. Therefore, plan everything you wnt. Thus, spend your money wisely.</p>

            <h4> WHAT YOU CAN DO:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="change">
                    <p><span class="change">Stick to a budget.</span>Write down all your expenses, and put them in categories. Then allocate funds for each expense. If you overspend in one category, take money from another to cover the difference. For example,</P>
                </li>
                </li>
            </ul>

<p>if you spent more than you planned on automobile fuel, take money set aside for a less important purpose-for example, dining out.</p>

<ul>
    <li class="change">
        <p><span class="change">Avoid unnecessary debt.</span>To the extent possible, avoid going into debt. Instead, save up to buy the items you need. If you use a credit card, try to pay off your balance in full each month to avoid paying interest. If you are in debt, set up a repayment plan, and then stick to it.</P>
            <p>One study suggests that when paying with a credit card, people are prone to spend more. So if you have a credit card, use it with restraint.</p>

<h3 style="color: #e8b923">BEWARE OF HARMFUL ATTITUDES</h3>
            <p><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: "The lazy one does not plow in winter, so he will be begging during the harvest when he has nothing."-Proverbs 20:4.</strong></p>
