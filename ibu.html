            <p>“THE LOSS OF A JOB,”
                says the American Psychological Association, “can be devastating, putting
                unemployed workers at risk for physical illness, marital strain, anxiety,
                depression and even suicide. Loss of a job affects every part of life.”</p>

            <p>Stress is your body’s response to a demanding
                situation. Your brain causes hormones to
                flood your system. These increase your
                heart rate, regulate your blood pressure, expand
                or constrict the capacity of your lungs,
                and tense your muscles. Before you are fully
                aware of what is happening, your body is
                primed for action. When a stressful episode
                is over, your body comes off “high alert” and</p>

                <p>“My wife left me, and I had to raise two children
                    on my own. It was hard being a single parent. On
                    top of that, I lost my job and I couldn’t afford to
                    get my vehicle inspected for registration. I had
                    no idea how to handle things. The stress was
                    overwhelming. I knew deep down that it was
                    wrong to kill myself, so I begged God to end my
                    misery.”—Barry.

                <p>“Everyone has stress to some degree, yet I
                    am overwhelmed with stress. It is not from just
                    one big problem but from many situations, from
                    struggles, and from seemingly unending years of
                    caring for my physically and mentally ill husband.”—

                    Like Jill and Barry, do you sometimes feel overwhelmed
                    with stress? If so, may the following articles comfort and
                    help you. They examine common causes of stress, how
                    stress can affect us, and how we can get at least a measure
                    of stress relief.
