            <p> As noted at the outset, many people consider the Bible to be a sacred book. They find that when they
                read it and apply its guidance, they feel uplifted spiritually and come to understand their purpose in
                life.</p>

            <p> The Bible uses the word "spirituality" to refer to an attitude or an approach to life. (Jude 18,19)
                Unlike a fleshly-minded person, who focuses more on self, those with a spiritual outlook value God's
                standards.-Ephesians 5:1.</p>
        
        <h4 style="color: #e8b923">HOPE</h4>
        <p><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: "If you become discouraged in times of trouble, your strength will be
                meager."<br>-Proverbs 24:10, footnote</strong></p>
        <p><span>WHAT IT MEANS: </span> Discouragement can sap us of the stregnth we need in order to deal with
            life's problems. On the other hand, hope can give us the courage to keep going. It can be com- </p>

            <p>forting to acknowledge that the problems we face may well be temporary; in fct, something good may
                come from them.</p>

            <p><span>WHAT CAN YOU DO: </span> Try to have an optimistic view of the future. Instead of worrying about
                what <em><span>might</em></span> happen or waiting for the perfect set of circumstances, take action in harmony with your
                goals, Granted, "unexpected events" can occur. (Ecclesiaster 9:11) Realistically, though, things
                often turn out better than we may expect. Thus, using an agricultural metaphor, the Bible says: "Sow
                your seed in the morning and do not let your hand rest until the evening: for you do not know which
                will have success, whether this one or that one, or whether they will both do
                well."<br>-Ecclesiastes 11:6.</p>
