            <p><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: "Bad associations corrupt<br>good morals."-1 Corinthians 15:33.</strong></p>


            <p><span>WHAT IT MEANS: </span>The people you spend time with<br>have a great influence on you-for good
                or for<br>bad. Sociologists agree that such influence can<br>affect your life. Foe example, they say
                that if you<br>surround yourself with people who smoke or who<br>are getting divorced, you may be
                more likely to<br>start smoking or to want a divorce.</p>

            <p><span>WHAT YOU CAN DO: </span>Make friends with people<br>who display qualities and have values you
                admire<br>or want to imitate. For instance, seek association<br>with people who are tactful,
                respectful, generous,<br>and hospitable.</p>
