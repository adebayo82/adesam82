            <p> The Bible warns againts emotions that are harmful and encourages us to cultivate those that are
                beneficial.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #e8b923">ANGER</h3>

            <p><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: "The one slow to ager is better than a mighty man."-proverbs
                    16:32.</strong></p>
            <p><span>WHAT IT MEANS: </span> We benefit when we develop the streght to control our emotions. Although
                some anger may be justified at times, uncontrolled anger is destructive. Modern researchers point out
                that in the heat of the moment, angry people often say or do things that they will later regret.</p>

            <p><span>WHAT YOU CAN DO: </span> Learn to control your anger before it controls you. While some people
                think that uncontrolled anger is a sign of strenght, we are wise to recognize that it is really a sign
                of weakness. "As a city broken through, without a wall, is the man who control his temper,"</p>

        <div>
            <div class="secondcolumn">

                <p> says the Bible. (Proverbs 25:28) A practical way to control your anger is to get the facts before
                    reacting. "The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger." (Proverbs 19:11) We do well to
                    listen carefully to both sides of a matter, which may provide insight that can steady our emtions.

                <p><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: "Show yourselves thankful." -2Colossian 3:15.</strong></p>

                <p><span>WHAT IT MEANS: It has been said that only a greatful person can be happy. Even those who have
                        gone through tremendous loss can attest to this. They point out that the key to their emotional
                        survival has been to focus on-not what they lost-but what they have to be greatful for.</span>
                </p>

                <p><span>WHAT YOU CAN DO: Each day, make a list of the things that you can greatful for. these do not
                        have to be major things. Reflect on even the small things, such as a beautiful sunrise, a
                        pleasant</span></p>
